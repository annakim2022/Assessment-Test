# Assessment-Test
This is a simulation where you run the code and the terminal asks you, the customer, what you want and assigns you an order number and robot.
Currently the robot and chef classes don't do anything and not all functions are finished so some questions ask you something and don't do anything.
The most working path is to answer 1, 1, then whatever numbers you want from there.
